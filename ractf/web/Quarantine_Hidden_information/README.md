Hi this is mywriteup about Quarantine - Hidden Information challenge from ractf. This challenge is categorized as web challenge and i think we only use our enumeration skill for this one. This challange was running at 95.216.233.106:11477. As you can see from problem description we need to find a hidden file, so at first i guess there is something in robots.txt and i checked robots.txt file. I got a dir named admin-stash.
