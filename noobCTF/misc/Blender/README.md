# Challenge Title: Blender

## Description
The pr03ssor is back with a new MISSION!

Link : http://159.89.163.214:5959

## Solution

Here we have a link to which runs a clip from money hesit, nothing much in source code 

cheked `/robots.txt` and got this

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /flag.html
```

got this  `/flag.html`

So the clue says `Check out author's margatsnI`

the reverse of `margatsnI` is `Instagram`. So from author instagram i got this post with comment

Rot13 of `uggcf://jjj.fubeggb.pbz/eri01-gkg` will give a url `https://www.shortto.com/rev01-txt`

From the url we get a txt file which has hex value in it. So i download that file and decoded the hex value and save it in file turns out it is a jpeg file and we get the image of proffesor 

`cat noob\ \(2\).txt | xxd -r -p > data `

So i used stegsolve on that image and started changing channel and i got this data in one of the channel `H3ispr0f3ssorn00b`

used that data to stegide and got some hex encoded file again

i tried to decode the hex but it was all rubbish

so i tried to reverse the hex and then decode and it turns out to be png image but it was broken

so edited the magic bytes of png to the file using hexeditor

so after opening the image we got the flag `noob{pr0f3ssor_1s_l33t}` which turns out to a fake one :(

![alt text](https://github.com/karma9874/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/NoobCTF_0x1/Images/fake_flag.JPG)

so remeber the page from `/flag.html` we need to submit the fake flag there to get real flag

so we get the flag from there `noob{y0u_w0rk3d_h4rd_f0r_pr0f3ssor_s0_y0u_4re_IN}`
