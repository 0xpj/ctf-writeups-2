## Solution

The given hash is md5 , I tried to crack the hash with john with the given text but no luck

So i created a wordlist from all given words
```
a=["Alice","January","1994","USA","25","Security"]
import itertools
for j in range(6):
	for i in itertools.permutations(a,j):
		print(''.join(i))
```
