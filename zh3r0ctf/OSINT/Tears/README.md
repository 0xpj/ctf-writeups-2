### Solution: 

This challenge is really unique and awesome credit goes to the author.

I've tried many OSINT tools but didn't get anything then There's a big hint in challenge description(the thing which made us cry is onion).
so after thinking alot i thought the account is not present on surface web and because of that no tool is returning anything usefull. so i started tor and surfing it i've checked the social platforms present on the deep web.

There's one related to challenge

visit the above url using tor then in search section search for "un1v3rsek1ng"

then we got some results just see below there's a post like un1v3rsek1ng is my friend by "G4l4xyK1nG"

just go to that profile you see the image and in that image there's cipher:

![cipher](cipher.png)

>H>#*T0RGKkBeXFG?Xe%1DJ*<n1LG5[1idYE0P4[%Ed<'

That cipher was base85 just use cyberchef and decode that you got the flag.

### Flag:
